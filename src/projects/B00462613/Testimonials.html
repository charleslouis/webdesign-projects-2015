        <p>Freeletics is special in what they have to offer as a way of social engagement with other “Free athletes” (their term, not mine) and the motivation they build in you by transforming exercise into a sport (which you can do alone or in a group). Recently I was approached by a stranger who was also doing freeletics and he suggested we workout together. Once you start Freeletics, you will recognise other free athletes by the frantic pace of the exercises. Soon after you visit their website you will be hooked by the testimonials and progress videos posted by the different users. </p>

        <p> So here I was, wanting to get in shape and having time to do it. For about a year I had been reading and hearing about CrossFit and I wanted to try it out. It was just becoming very popular here in Chile, so there were only a few places were you can practice it -now it's a big boom- The thing is, joining a "gym", even if it's a CrossFit box, is not really my style. Paying, feeling obliged to go, spending time travelling to go to a place to exercise when you coud do it somewhere else... Still I was was attracted by the team philosophy behind it. </p>

        <p>Done! 15 weeks of the Freeletics Strength Workout completed and I feel so much better for it! My strength & stamina have increased massively, I have dropped two waist sizes in jeans (now a 30 inch and even they are a bit big!).Body fat % has dropped by 6% from 19.9% to 13.9%. I’m not lying when I say that physically, I am in the best shape of my life and so pleased I have stuck at this.I would definitely recommend Freeletics to anyone who is looking to get into shape and lacks tone & definition (as I did when I started) -I did the Strength coach and it contained the right amount of cardio to strength training for me to achieve my goal of building muscle mass whilst losing fat. I do think my results would have been more impressive if I was eating a calorie surplus (needed to build muscle) but I was operating on a deficit as my main goal was to lose my beer belly.</p>
